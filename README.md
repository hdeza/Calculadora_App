# Calculator App

**Project developed in Flutter**

## Features

### Basic Calculator

#### Allows:
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers.
  - Performing operations with decimals.
  - Deleting numbers one by one.
  - Clearing all data (Reset).

## Development Approach

The code was developed in a simple manner, using **StatelessWidget** and **StatefulWidget**. No specific state management solutions such as Bloc, Provider, or GetX were implemented. Additionally, object-oriented programming was used to better organize and maintain the data (numbers).
